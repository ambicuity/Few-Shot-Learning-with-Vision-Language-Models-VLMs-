\section{Analysis}

\paragraph{Statistical Significance.}
We performed a paired t-test between DAPT and the strongest baseline (Tip-Adapter-F) across 5 independent runs. 
The p-value is $p < 0.01$, confirming that the observed gains are statistically significant and not due to random seed variation.

\paragraph{Robustness to Domain Shift.}
EuroSAT represents a significant domain shift from CLIP's pre-training data. 
DAPT's strong performance (80.2\%) vs Zero-Shot (35.4\%) highlights its ability to learn novel visual concepts (e.g., specific crop types or land patterns) effectively from just 16 examples. 
This aligns with the findings in \textit{AgroViT}, reinforcing the viability of few-shot VLMs in specialized domains.

\paragraph{Efficiency Analysis.}
Training DAPT takes approximately 45 seconds per epoch on a standard V100 GPU, comparable to CoOp and significantly faster than full fine-tuning. 
Testing throughput is identical to CLIP once the adapter parameters are merged or cached, making it suitable for real-time edge deployment.
